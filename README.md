AIRI Summer School Project for Defect Prediction in Laser-Based Metal Additive Manufacturing using Machine-Learning Methods

# Abstract
Additive manufacturing enables the creation of materials layer by layer, resulting in complex geometries that require careful control of each layer to prevent manufacturing errors. The outcome is influenced by various factors, including printing parameters, material selection, and design configuration, which requires a series of expensive experiments to determine the optimal parameters. Due to the widespread use of single-shot or small-batch production in the field of additive technologies, researchers often work with limited data. Predicting defects in part creation requires taking into account multiple parameters, such as printing parameters, material properties, part shape, and environmental conditions, which have complex interrelations. Artificial intelligence tools offer a solution to identify these interrelations based on data observations. Multimodal models for defect identification and based on heterogeneous data collected from sensors during printing are applicable to this problem. The effectiveness of the model is enhanced by using different types of data and their combinations. This method allows for the prediction of a wider range of properties in additive manufacturing processes.
